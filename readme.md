# cwipc_realsense2

This project has software for capturing point clouds using RealSense cameras. The software turns RealSense depth- and colorframes into cwipc pointclouds.

It is a submodule of the _cwipc_ suite, <https://github.com/cwi-dis/cwipc>.

When installed it enables the use of RealSense D4xx cameras in cwipc.

This module requires the [RealsenseAI Librealsense](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense) SDK. 

See the toplevel [_cwipc_ readme file](../readme.md) for more information.
